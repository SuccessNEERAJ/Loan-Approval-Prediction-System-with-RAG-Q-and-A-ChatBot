- **Git Ignore**: `.env` file is automatically ignored by git
- **Example File**: Use `.env.example` as a template

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Running the Core System

```bash
python Loan_Prediction_&_AI_Chatbot.py
```

### Installing Development Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Add development tools if needed
pip install pytest black flake8
```

## üìà Model Performance

The system includes several features to ensure good model performance:

- **Regularization**: L1/L2 regularization to prevent overfitting
- **Early Stopping**: Automatic training termination when validation loss stops improving
- **Batch Normalization**: Improved training stability
- **Dropout**: Additional regularization technique
- **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Adaptive learning rate reduction
